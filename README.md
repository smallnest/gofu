# gofu

`gofu` is a go functional library, and  it means "kongfu".


It defines many interfaces (type contraint) that port from OpenJDK, Scala, C++ and other programming languages and libraries. They are the fundamental generic types to construct go functional libraries.

So far I only ported some generic function interfaces.
